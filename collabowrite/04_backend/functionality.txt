In this repo I added the ability to create a new story and add scenes to that story.
The two are both stored in datastore. In the future, scenes will have to be stored in 
Google Cloud Storage because they are supposed to be large. Hence the commented out storage.go.
Stories have a title, plot, and description. Scenes are the components of stories, and include
content and a scene name. Stories can be browsed using the "Browse" page and viewed by clicking on them. 
This is where the scenes are displayed, in chronological order. The idea is that users can write
their stories, browse and read others' stories, and (in the future) join another's story and contribute
to them collaboritvely.
