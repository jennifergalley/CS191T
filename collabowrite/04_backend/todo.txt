# Plans for the website:

Add ability to use Google account for sign-in
Add "About" page with story of how the website started, why I made it, etc.
Buy a Google domain name for the site and use that instead of appspot domain.
Add "Support" page with ability to email me directly with feature requests, 
	bug reports, problems they've expereinced, etc. using the email tied to the domain name.
Add "Donate" page with various ways of donating to me directly. Maybe set up an account 
	just for the donations + charges for the site's operation so it can be self-sustaining. 
	Explain why I'm	asking for donations.
Make sure the site works awesome in mobile. This may be the main way people use the site.
Develop an Android app for the site, maybe using the website inside an application shell.
Add meta information to the site so it will show up in Google and Bing search results.
Add advertisments to the site so it can make some revenue. These will be noninvasive, 
	on the sides of the pages. Proceeds will go towards the site's operation.
Investigate if google cloud and app engine and datstore are the way to go long-term, 
	in terms of cost-effectiveness. Maybe migrate to AWS or Azure as needed.
Make a terms of use page explaining that any content they post may be completely public and I 
	will not be held responsible for anything. Encourage them to use a different password from 
	any other site if they make a local account, as security is very important. Explain that
	their content will remain entirely theirs and that all scenes belong to the author who wrote them 
	irrespective of the stories they are a part of, and all users maintain the rights to their own writing.
	Users abusing the site will be removed (not sure how to do this?)
Advertise the site on social networks and other creative writing platforms to attract users. 
	Maybe do this through Google ads. 
Add email authentication before the signup process is complete, so they have to verify their email
	address is valid before proceeding. This will prevent spammers and blacklisted users coming back.
